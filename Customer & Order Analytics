#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. One table contains order IDs and account numbers, 
and the other tables contain the order information (each month has its own table).

-- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

-- How many orders in January were placed for iPhones?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--Provide a list of account numbers for all orders places in Feburary.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

--What product was the cheapest product sold in January and what was its price?
SELECT distinct Product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product <> ''
AND Product <> 'Product'
GROUP BY Product

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product

--How many customers ordered 2 or more of one type of product in an order and what was the average amount spent in an order for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity > 2 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND OrderID IS NOT NULL
AND OrderID <> 'Order ID'
